The aim of hate_group is to do some exploration of how hate groups might congregate in one area vs another.

### starting point...
Figure out some mini-goals since I don't have a specific end goal in mind...

TODO:
1. Migrate Southern Poverty Law Center 2020 hate group data into a sqlite3 data table. (done)
2. List states by how many hate groups they have in them. (done)
3. Find and download dataset that shows the number of people living in each state. (done)
4. Think about if there is a relationship between proliferation of hate groups with respect to the population of a state.
5. Figure out how to get proper headers in markdown for these readme docs.(done)
6. Write endpoints that provide nationwide and state by state hate data. (done)
7. Set up bootstrap / jquery interface that displays state level and nationwide level hata group data. (done)
